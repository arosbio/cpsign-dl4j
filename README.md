# cpsign-dl4j
This repo contains an extension to CPSign with the possibility to build DL models using the DL4J library. This package is rather large and also has the possibility to use hardware acceleration when possible, so in the future this will be a public repo where advanced users can make the appropriate changes to allow for better computing performance.
